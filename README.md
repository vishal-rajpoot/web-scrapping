To collect all the data from the html page.

So, basically there are three tasks. 

1. Retrieve all the content from any html page by giving a url as an input, and print in a readable form on the screen and save it in a new "TEMP" html file.

2. Then read all the images or img tags from that url and print no. of img tags on the screen.

3. After that, read all the anchor tags from that url and print no. of anchor tags on the screen.
